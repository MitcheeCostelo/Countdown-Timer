# Countdown Timer by Mitchee Costelo
The Countdown Timer is designed to let users set a time limit and the page will count down from the time to zero.

## Setup
1. Download files here on github
2. Navigate to directory
3. Open `index.html` file using any preferred web browser

## Future changes / fixes
- add media queries in the CSS file so the program can be properly viewed at any resolution
- add animations when hovering over / pressing buttons
- Directly change time display instead of having a new window open asking for minutes
- Allow users to adjust amount of seconds
- Fix timer so when you reset, it doesn't subtract one second initially off of the original time
